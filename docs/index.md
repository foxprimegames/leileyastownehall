## 0. Please join the guild's Discord
The guild has a discord chat at [](https://discord.gg/uJMA6U3).  Please join that to be able to see guild announcements, and to be able to notify the guild officers if needed.

## 1. Be kind to other members.
If someone does something that you do not like, please try to let officers know of it. Anyone who becomes abusive to other members will be given a warning but upon a second offense will be kicked from the guild.

## 2. If you need help, feel free to ask anyone about it.
This includes needing items that you cannot seem to get on your own.

## 3. Please invest in the guild's current project.
There will always be one building highlighted in the city.  This is the guild's current investment project.  Please help invest in that building as much as possible.

## 4. Please let us know if you're not going to be active.
Members who don't connect to the game for 7 days will be kicked from the guild.

Please notify one of the guild officers if you're going to be inactive and for how long.

## 5. Please do bounties
Finishing bounties helps the guild - points gained from bounties allow the guild to give crafting bonuses, resource generation bonuses, etc.

Please finish as many bounties as you can each week to help the guild help everyone :)

## 6. Rejoining after being kicked
If you have been kicked from the guild for any reason, you may rejoin once.
If you are kicked a second time, you will be placed on the permanent-ban list.  At that point, if you rejoin the guild again, you will be kicked without notice.
